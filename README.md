## üî® How to install this project?
### Stack
First of all, make sure that you have the following technologies in your environment:
- Java 17
- Kotlin
- Node.js
- MySQL

### Git clone
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/wilknisoliveira/hi-home.git
```

### Database
- Create a schema with MySQL to host your tables. You can name it as 'city_point';
- In IntelliJ or Eclipse, configure a Run/Debug Configurations with the following Environments variables (replace the lines YOUR_*):
```
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:YOUR_PORT/city_point?useTimezone=true&serverTimezone=UTC;
DB_USER=YOUR_USER;
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_KEY;
```

### dotenv
- To use the Google Maps API, you need to create a free account in the Google Cloud Platform. There you will get a key to use in your projects. You can learn more about it in this [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
- At the frontend folder, create a file 'key.env' and insert the following lines:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Install Node dependencies
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run this project?
- Open a terminal:
```bash
cd frontend/src
node server.js
```
- From IntelliJ or Eclipse, run the Run/Debug Configuration that you created in the previous steps.
- Now you can:
1. Start the frontend at http://localhost:3000/;
2. See the Swagger documentation of the City Point API from http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html.
